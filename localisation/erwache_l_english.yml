 erwache.1.d:0 "We have two appointment options for the offices of Reichsbank President and Economic Minister. One of the possible appointees, Hjalmar Schacht, is very good at working with Germany's companies and developing civilain infrastructure, but his lack of loyalty to the NSDAP and distain for military spending make him a worrying choice. Our second possible appointee, Walther Funk, is very loyal to the NSDAP and is a major proponent of military spending. If we are to make any good progress with German recovery, we must choose one of these two men to lead our economy."
