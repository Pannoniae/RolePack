The traditional nukes are for tactical use ( against units ) they do little damage to a state and population and next to no surrender progress. The balistic missiles land within the selected state and do heavy damage to the state and population and are not intended for use against troops."

The NBC unit is primairily designed to protect units against radiation once the levels get extreme."

A korps requires a staff ratio of 1 staff per 3 divisions, lack of staff will result in less effective divisions sufficient or a larger than nessisairy amount of divisional staff will result in a combat bonus. \nStaff can be placed anywhere within a korps even as a division on its own."

For the time being you will need the waking the tiger dlc to propperly use it, I will create a non dlc version in the future."
