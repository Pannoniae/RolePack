chemical_warfare_tech: "Chemical Warfare"
chemical_warfare_tech_desc: "One might say these times are dire enough to consider using these weapons once again. But if we decide to employ these weapons, there will be retaliation by our enemies and the international community.\n"
chemical_technology_desc: "After the brutality, death and misery chemical warfare has brought upon the people during the Great War, most nations became very hesitant at employing these weapons of horror again; especially considering most leaders witnessed the torment of these weapons first hand.\n"
chemical_ammo_subtitle1_label: "Chemical Ammunition"
chemical_ammo_subtitle1_tt: "Chemical shells to attack the enemy with."

chemical_incendiary_subtitle_tt: "Incendiary shells, bullets and bombs."

gas_blue_cross: "Blue Cross"
GER_gas_blue_cross: "Blaukreuz"
gas_blue_cross_desc: "Blue Cross are chemical agents affecting the upper respiratory tract or general incapacitating agents. Amongst the most common agents are diphenylchloroarsine and diphenylcyanoarsine. Agents such as this cause nausea, violent vomiting and even pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs); while often not inherently lethal, they help at exposing the enemy and hinder them at mounting a good defence. Blue Cross shells are mixed in with ordinary high-explosive shells, concealing the gas and making it hard to differentiated such an attack from ordinary shelling."
gas_blue_cross2: "Blue Cross II"
GER_gas_blue_cross2: "Blaukreuz Zwei"
gas_blue_cross2_desc: "More effective lung irritants such as lewisite, that also cause blistering, and improvements in mixture, together with advancements for shells and delivery will further enhance our irritants, increasing their power to erode the enemy's ability to put up a effective resistance."

gas_green_cross: "Green Cross"
GER_gas_green_cross: "Grünkreuz"
gas_green_cross_desc: "Green Cross agents were the cause of around 80% off all deaths from chemical warfare during the Great War. Green Cross agents are pulmonary agents such as phosgene/chlorine, trichloromethyl chloroformate and chloropicrin/nitrochloroform that destroy the lung-blood barrier resulting in Asphyxia."
gas_green_cross2: "Green Cross II"
GER_gas_green_cross2: "Grünkreuz Zwei"
gas_green_cross2_desc: "Improvements in our pulmonary agents increased their toxicity and thus lethality. Agents such as disulfur decafluoride and acrolein are many times more toxic than phosgene."

gas_yellow_cross: "Yellow Cross"
GER_gas_yellow_cross: "Gelbkreuz"
gas_yellow_cross_desc: "Yellow Cross agents are chemical agents that affect exposed surfaces of the victim's body, causing extensive blistering. The most common one used during the Great War was dichloroethylsulfide (sulfur mustard), but other nerve agents can fall into this category, too. These agents cause extreme and debilitating chemical burns all across the body and can penetrate wool and cotton. Further if inhaled, these nerve agents cause bleeding and blistering within the respiratory system, causing the lungs to fill with blood and exposed eyes result in temporary blindness."
gas_yellow_cross2: "Yellow Cross II"
GER_gas_yellow_cross2: "Gelbkreuz Zwei"
gas_yellow_cross2_desc: "The lethality and toxicity of our nerve agents have been increased, making them deadlier then ever. New agents such as sarin and cyanogen chloride are new ways to debilitate or kill our enemies."

simple_gasmasks: "Simple Gas masks"
simple_gasmasks_desc: "Simple gas masks developed during the Great War. They may have many flaws, but they are the best we have for now. These masks can counter the gas employed during the Great War."
gasmask_training: "Advanced Gas Mask Training"
gasmask_training_desc: "Donning a gas mask quick and effectively and engaging in combat with one on is no easy task. However, with better training our soldiers can become better at that task and even use their new-found skills to mount an unexpected counter-offensive."
improved_gasmask: "Improved Gas masks"
improved_gasmask_desc: "These new improved gas masks are better at shielding the wearer from new and more harmful chemical attacks. New methods such as impregnation and better filtration methods should keep even the most toxic of gases from the wearer."
advanced_filters: "Advanced Filters"
advanced_filters_desc: "New advanced filters and improvements in usability make it much easier for our troops to engage in combat while wearing gas masks."
chemical_white_p_technology: "White Phosphorus"
chemical_white_p_technology_desc: "Developed during the great war as a smoke generating, we can fully embrace the incendiary capabilities of white phosphorus. We can use WP grenades for infantry, mortar and artillery shells and even tank shells. By changing the ordinance's charge composition, we can cause the incandescent particles by the initial explosion to be spread across a larger area; these particles stick to surfaces such as skin, causing deep burns to victims, but also tank armour and vision slits, emitting blinding smoke for the occupants of the hit vehicle."
napalm_tech: "Napalm"
napalm_tech_desc: "We have discovered that a jelly mixture of naphthenic and palmitic acids greatly increases the effectiveness of our incendiary weapons. We can use these mixtures in our vehicle and man-portable flamethrowers and we can use it to bomb enemy positions by planes."
