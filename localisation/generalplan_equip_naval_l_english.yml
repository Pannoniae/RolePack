 BUR_submarine_2:0 "Type IIA"
 BUR_submarine_2_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935."
 #BUR_submarine_2b: "Type VIIA"
 BUR_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC"
 BUR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 #BUR_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 BUR_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 BUR_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 BUR_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 BUR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 BUR_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 BUR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5" guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 BUR_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 BUR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9") guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 BUR_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 BUR_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 BUR_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 BUR_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9") guns in single turrets."
 #BUR_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 BUR_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 BUR_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 BUR_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 BUR_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 BUR_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 BUR_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8" guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 BUR_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 BUR_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 BUR_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 BUR_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 BUR_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15") guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 BUR_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 BUR_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 BUR_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 BUR_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 BUR_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 BUR_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 BUR_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 BUR_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."
 BUR_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 BUR_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 BUR_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 BUR_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 BUR_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 BUR_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 BUR_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 BUR_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 BUR_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 BUR_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 BUR_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 BUR_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20") guns."
