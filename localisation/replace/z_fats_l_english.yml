 GER_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Schneeglöckchen was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun mounted on a Tiger ausf. E chassis. It was armed with two 88 mm Flak 41 guns. However, the added weight of these monstrous guns made the vehicle slow, and it required frequent servicing due to its high complexity and low reliability."

 GER_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_3:0 "Flakpanzer VI Ausf. B Rittersporne"
 GER_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "Due to the \"make it bigger\" doctrine, the Königstiger chassis had to be converted into a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. The resulting gun was a montrosity; it mounted a single 128mm Flak 45. With the 12 tons of added weight, the Rittersporne was even more unsuitable for the Blitzkrieg doctrine and it could not cross most bridges safely. Despite these drawbacks, the design was a success since it provided a somewhat mobile platform for shooting down any aircraft trying to bomb Germany."

 GER_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Sturmtiger"
 GER_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Sturmtiger was a really intimidating weapon with its 380mm rockets being able to obliterate anything on the battlefield. Its major drawback was its reload time - it took more than 15 minutes to reload one rocket and the crew had to exit the tank to load a new shell using a crane in the back."

 GER_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Based on the hull of a King Tiger the Geschützwagen Tiger was to be able to mount a 170mm K72 L/50 gun. The tank was not too successful mainly due to its sheer size - self-propelled artillery pieces simply did not need that much armour as nothing should have been directly targeting them. The chassis had the same mechanical problems as the famed Tiger II, amplified by the careless assembly of the gun since production capacity mainly went towards the Entwicklung series."

 GER_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B"
 GER_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdtiger was the heaviest armored fighting vehicle operationally used during World War II. The vehicle carried a 128 mm PaK 44 L/55 main gun and had almost impenetrable frontal armor. However, it was very immobile and did not have a turret so field manuals have ordered to use the tank very defensively like an anti-tank gun, then simply obliterate any artillery piece trying to counter-barrage the vehicle."

 GER_super_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Another one of Hitler's Wunderwaffen, this 210mm artillery gun mounted on a Maus chassis was an absolute waste of production capacity. While it had even more destructive power than the Soviet B-3, the E-100 chassis was quite slow so unlike the regular E-100 - which could easily defend itself - it was really easily counter-barraged with armour-piercing shells."

 GER_super_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Jagdpanzer VIII Maus"
 GER_super_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The chassis of a Maus with a 150mm gun in a fixed superstructure. Unlike the Jagdtiger, this design was simply unusable with a maximum speed of 7 km/h and a firing rate of 23 rounds per hour, with production quickly switched to the autoloaded E-100 and the Jagdpanzer E-100."

 GER_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer E-50 was the standardised self-propelled anti-aircraft gun in Germany after 1946. It mounted twin 88mm Flak guns in a fully rotating turret based on the E-50 hull. The tank was to crewed by four crewmen and was to carry 104 rounds of ammunition."

 GER_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "SturmPz E-50"
 GER_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The SturmPz E-50 was created learning the lessons from the Sturmtiger. It had an autoloader which loaded the 380mm rockets for the launcher. The tank had a crew of five crewmen and carried 36 rounds. It was successfully used in demolishing enemy fortifications in the counter-offensives following the collapse of '44."
 GER_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Jagdpanzer E-25 Standardpanzer"
 GER_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "An updated version of the Jagdpanzer IV, the E-25 was faster and better armoured. Its low silouette gave it the rightly-deserved title of a Panzerjager and its 128mm PaK44 cannon was highly effective against most mass-produced Allied tanks."
 GER_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short:0 "JagdPz E-25"
 GER_modern_tank_equipment_1:0 "Standardpanzer E-50"
 GER_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 " The Standardpanzer E-50 was the standard heavy tank replacing the Panther and Tiger tank series and the conversions based on those tanks. It mounted a truly marvelous 105mm KwK45 L/55 main gun which was able to penetrate anything it encountered at basically any angle. Truly a pinnacle of German engineering, it was expensive to produce and it was plagued with early reliability issues. However, later variants solved most of them, making this tank a strong contender for the best tank of the century."
