IMPFED_protect_centroamerica_desc:0 " The minor nations of Central America find themselves under diplomatic pressure from the strong-arm of Mexico, threatened by 'interventions' from the United States, and forced into near-economic-slavery in the so-called 'Banana Republics' by the United Fruit Company. We however, could form the perfect counter-balance, and free them from their misery - they need only to join us as a partner in the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_panama_canal:0 "The Panama Problem"
IMPFED_panama_canal_desc:0 "The Panama Canal sits in a major trade route between our Pacific and Atlantic holdings. However, since the completeion of the Canal in 1914 by the Americans, it has been held and ran by a single nation, giving them the power to open and close the route as they please.

We must ensure that this threat is ended, by force if necessary."
