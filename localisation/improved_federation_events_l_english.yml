IMPFED_events.1.t:0 "Inviting Ireland to the Imperial Conference"
IMPFED_events.1.d:0 "Our recent relations with Ireland have been frought with conflict with long-standing grievances boiling over in their war of independence in 1919-22. Following the conclusion of that war in 1922, we agreed to establish the Irish Free State - a self-governing state on a similar standing as our dominions. Since then, relations have continued to be strained over a protracted trade war, but tensions seem to finally be cooling.\n\n Ireland is now moving towards a formal establishment of home rule under a new constitution, but is still considered by many to be a member of the commonwealth. This may be our final opportunity to reach out the hand of friendship and support the unionist cause. Two questions remain however: how much effort are we willing to make to try to bring them to the table, and will they listen to us?"
IMPFED_events.1.a:0 "We shall send a cordial invitation"
IMPFED_events.1.b:0 "Make some diplomatic niceties to try and convince them to attend"
IMPFED_events.1.c:0 "Spend a tremendous amount of effort to convince them to attend"
IMPFED_events.2.t:0 "An invitation to the Imperial Conference"
IMPFED_events.2.d:0 "We have recieved an invitation to join the Imperial Conference hosted by the United Kingdom. Though we are well on our way to complete self-rule already, many consider us to still be a member of the commonwealth, and Britain is offering us a seat on equal footing to their dominions at the conference.\n\n This could be an opportunity to benefit from increased trade with the Britsh Empire, but it would of course, bring us closer to coming under British rule once more."
IMPFED_events.2.a:0 "We shall hear what they have to say"
IMPFED_events.2.b:0 "A member of their Empire? Never!"
IMPFED_events.3.t:0 "Ireland Accepts our Invitation"
IMPFED_events.3.d:0 "Ireland has agreed to send a representative to negotiate on their behalf in the Imperial Conference"
IMPFED_events.3.a:0 "Let's hope we can smooth things over this time..."
IMPFED_events.4.t:0 "Ireland declines our Invitation"
IMPFED_events.4.d:0 "Ireland has rejected our invitation to the Imperial Conference, stressing that they are no longer interested in the affairs of our Empire."
IMPFED_events.4.a:0 "Truly a shame..."
IMPFED_events.5.t:0 "Unionism Triumphs in Ireland!"
IMPFED_events.5.d:0 "The Irish delegation has responded well to our new offers of Federation, and has unexpectedly agreed to join us as an equal partner in a unified commonwealth!"
IMPFED_events.5.a:0 "Excellent!"
IMPFED_events.6.t:0 "Ireland rejects the idea of Federation"
IMPFED_events.6.d:0 "To the surprise of no-one, Ireland has rejected the idea of joining us in the Imperial Federation, re-iterating their preference for home-rule that they fought the War of Independence for. With any hopes of bolstering the unionist cause and reuniting the isles thoroughly dashed, we can at least come away from this with the satisfaction that they gave them the time of day, and made accomodation for productive trade talks."
IMPFED_events.6.a:0 "They walk their own path..."
IMPFED_events.7.t:0 "Ireland returns to Dominion Status"
IMPFED_events.7.d:0 "Earlier today, the foreign ministers of [ENG.GetnameDef] and [IRE.GetnameDef] made a remarkable announcement, declaring Ireland's return to the British Empire as a dominion, following negotiations at the Imperial Conference. This announcement has surprised the global community, as it reverses recent moves to establish formal home rule in Ireland. \n The Irish Foreign Minister announced that this was the beginning of 'a brand new age for Ireland, free of the troubles of the past, standing not as a subject or enemy of their neighbour, but as a friend and equal.' Elsewhere however, IRA cells have already sworn to continue the fight for freedom against British rule, denouncing the actions of the 'traitors' who have betrayed their country in London."
IMPFED_events.7.a:0 "The Empire Grows Stronger..."
IMPFED_events.7.b:0 "Welcome to our new friends!"
IMPFED_events.7.c:0 "We shall be stronger together"
IMPFED_events.9.t:0 "The West Indies Federation"
IMPFED_events.9.d:0 " The conidtion of the West Indies is plain for all to see: In the past years, we have made great steps forward in our caribbean possessions, granting them full citizenship as commonwealth citizens and rapidly developing the islands with infrastructure and industry, providing jobs and benefitting the economic development of the region. Meanwhile however, islands beyond our control stand as either independent realms struggling under American dominance, or largely neglected and underdeveloped island colonies. With this fact in tow, we have grounds to request that the caribbean islands be transfered to us as a mandate to develope.
IMPFED_events.9.a:0 "Request the Mandate"
IMPFED_events.9.b:0 "Let us not overreach ourselves"
IMPFED_events.10.t:0 "[ENG.GetnameDef] requests the transfer of our Caribbean Possessions"
IMPFED_events.10.d:0 "We have been contacted by [ENG.GetnameDef] requesting that we transfer our Caribbean holdings to them as part of an effort to establish a mandate over the whole of the West Indies"
IMPFED_events.10.a:0 "Very Well, they shall have their mandate"
IMPFED_events.10.b:0 "Handing over OUR islands? I think not!"
IMPFED_events.11.t:0 "[ENG.GetnameDef] requests the tranfer of our Guyana territory"
IMPFED_events.11.d:0 "We have been contacted by [ENG.GetnameDef] requesting that we transfer our Guyana holdings to them as part of an effort to establish a mandate over the whole of the West Indies. Needless to say however, there is quite good grounds for us to claim that Guyana is in fact, not part of the West Indies, limiting what they could realistically do against us in return."
IMPFED_events.11.a:0 "Very Well, they shall have their mandate"
IMPFED_events.11.b:0 "Guyana is not, and shall not be part of the West Indies"
IMPFED_events.12.t:0 "[ENG.GetnameDef] Invites us to the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_events.12.d:0 "As part of their expanding influence over the caribbean, the [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador has approached us with an offer: rather than standing alone against the world, we could join them as a dominion of [ENG.GetnameDef]. In return, we would recieve a not insignificant investment from the various domains of [ENG.GetnameDef], and a guarantee of citizenship for our people should we later join them. This would of course however, come at the cost of our independence. Opinion among our advisors and the [Root.GetAdjective] populace is divided on the issue: whilst we have no real ties, past or present to [ENG.GetnameDef], and there is not much enthusiasm for being subsumed under them, there is equally not much support for risking a war over this."
IMPFED_events.12.a:0 "Let us join [ENG.GetnameDef]"
IMPFED_events.12.b:0 "Our independence must be defended!"
IMPFED_events.13.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] transfers their islands to us"
IMPFED_events.13.d:0 "In support of our claim to a caribbean mandate, [FROM.GetnameDef] have handed over their Caribbean territory to us."
IMPFED_events.13.a:0 "Excellent"
IMPFED_events.14.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] refuses to hand over islands to us"
IMPFED_events.14.a:0 "Disappointing..."
IMPFED_events.15.t:0 "[From.GetnameDef] hands over Guyana territory to us"
IMPFED_events.15.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador has approved our request for their Guyana territory to be handed over to us in line with our request to be given a West Indies Mandate."
IMPFED_events.15.a:0 "Excellent"
IMPFED_events.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] refuses to hand over Guyana Territory to us"
IMPFED_events.16.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador has rebuked our attempt to convince them to transfer their Guyana territory to us as part of the West Indies Mandate, declaring that Guyana does not form part of the West Indies, and thus should remain under [FROM.GetAdjective] control"
IMPFED_events.16.a:0 "Disappointing..."
IMPFED_events.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] joins the Commonwealth!"
IMPFED_events.17.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador has returned to us with great news, declaring that the [FROM.Getname] Govenment has approved our request for a West Indies Mandate, and seeks to join the Commonwealth forthwith!"
IMPFED_events.17.a:0 "A toast to our new friends!"
IMPFED_events.18.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] declines our invitation to the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_events.18.d:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] has declined our invitation to the Commonwealth, their ambassador giving passing praise towards our efforts to establish a West Indian Mandate, but making a point to stress that [FROM.Getname] will not be part of it."
IMPFED_events.18.a:0 "Disappointing..."
IMPFED_events.19.t:0 "[ENG.GetnameDef] offers protection"
IMPFED_events.19.d:0 "An ambassador from [ENG.GetnameDef] has come to us with an offer of protection, declaring that [ENG.GetnameDef] will ensure that [ROOT.GetnameDef] is protected from other foreign incursions and influence, overturning the dominance of [USA.GetnameDef] in the region and the United Fruit Company. In return however, we would join them as a dominion of [ENG.getnamedef]. This would give us access to a large market and many [ENG.GetAdjective] investors, but would of course erode our independence..."
IMPFED_events.20.t:0 "The Question of the Panama Canal"
IMPFED_events.20.d:0 "With [ENG.GetnameDef] spanning the globe from East to West, the Panama Canal has become increasingly important in maintaining the integrity of our far-flung territories, and an unfortunate source of foreign influence over our shipping. The time has come therefore for us to act. The Federal government however remains divided. Some suggest that we should seek to make a similar deal to the Suez Canal, seeking to buy out a share, allowing us to claim influence over the canal, and even station troops there. Others however, suggest that we should force it to be demilitarised completely, so that it is harder for the owners to strong-arm us, as well as making it more vulnerable in the event of war. Others still suggest that, rather than asking for it to be handed over to ourselves, we should propose that Panama take control of the canal, who may be more amienable to our requests."
IMPFED_events.20.a:0 "Request a share in the Canal"
IMPFED_events.20.b:0 "Request the demilitarisation of the Canal"
IMPFED_events.20.c:0 "Request the Canal be handed over to Panama"
IMPFED_events.20.e:0 "Actually, I think we should have complete control of the Canal"
IMPFED_events.20.f:0 "The Current Situation Works for us"
IMPFED_events.21.t:0 "[ENG.getnamedef] demands changes in the Panama Canal!"
IMPFED_events.21.d:0 "The [ENG.getadjective] Ambassador has approached us with a list of demands, saying that [ENG.getnamedef] can no longer tolerate our complete ownership of the Panama Canal, which they consider to be imposing on their trans-pacific shipping routes"
IMPFED_events.21.a:0 "Very Well, they can buy a share in the Canal - for a price"
IMPFED_events.21.b:0 "Very Well, we shall demilitarise the Canal - unless we go to war, of course"
IMPFED_events.21.c:0 "Very Well, Panama shall have the Canal"
IMPFED_events.21.e:0 "We cannot risk a war over this - hand over the Canal"
IMPFED_events.21.f:0 "We refuse these demands!"
IMPFED_events.22.t:0 "[From.GetnameDef] grants us a share in the Panama Canal"
IMPFED_events.22.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] have agreed to sell us a share in the Panama Canal, we now stand as part-owners, similar to the French situation in Suez."
IMPFED_events.22.a:0 "Marvellous"
IMPFED_events.23.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] agrees to demilitarisation"
IMPFED_events.23.d:0 "A representative from [From.GetNameDef] has agreed to demilitarise the Canal, allowing our ships free and safe passage, though stressed that it will be important for them to be able to re-garisson the Canal should they find themselves at war."
IMPFED_events.23.a:0 "These terms are acceptable"
IMPFED_events.24.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] transfers the Canal to Panama"
IMPFED_events.24.d:0 "In response to our requests to alter the situation in the Panama Canal, the [FROM.GetAdjective] and [PAN.GetAdjective] ambassadors have met to arrange a formal handover of the Canal, which has now become sovreign [PAN.GetAdjective] territory"
IMPFED_events.24.a:0 "Excellent"
IMPFED_events.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] hands over the Panama Canal!"
IMPFED_events.25.d:0 "Afraid of our might and power, [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to hand over the Panama Canal to us"
IMPFED_events.25.a:0 "All according to plan..."
IMPFED_events.26.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] refuses to concede any part of the Panama Canal"
IMPFED_events.26.d:0 "In response to our requests, [FROM.GetnameDef] has made it quite clear to us that they have no intent to give even an inch on the issue of the Panama Canal, claiming that it is completely and utterly theirs by right!"
IMPFED_events.26.a:0 "This will not stand!"
IMPFED_events.27.t:0 "Remilitarisation of the Panama Canal"
IMPFED_events.27.d:0 "Now that we are at war, the Panama Canal has been remilitarised, so that we may defend it against hostile invasion"
IMPFED_events.27.a:0 "All as needs be."
IMPFED_events.28.t:0 "Approaching the Arab Princes"
IMPFED_events.28.d:0 "We are in a position, given our shared history of co-operation with the Arabs following their independence from the Ottoman Empire, to offer the Arab Princes the opportunity to join the Commonwealth. The question remains however, how much effort we are willing to spend to convince them to join us?"
IMPFED_events.28.a:0 "We shall ask them nicely"
IMPFED_events.28.b:0 "Spend some effort to convince them"
IMPFED_events.28.c:0 "Spend a tremendous amount of effort to convice them to our side"
IMPFED_events.28.e:0 "On second thought, the current situation suits us just fine."
IMPFED_events.29.t:0 "[ENG.getnamedef] invites us to the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_events.29.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador has approached us with an offer of 'protection', inviting us to join the commonwealth as an autonomous dominion. In return we would be protected from potentially hostile foreign powers, and would recieve funds from Commonwealth investors, but would sacrifice our national sovreignity."
IMPFED_events.29.a:0 "We shall gladly join the Commonwealth" 
IMPFED_events.29.b:0 "Our independence is non-negotiable"
IMPFED_events.30.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] agrees to join the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_events.30.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] representative has responded favourably to our invitation, signalling that [FROM.GetNameDef]'s entry to the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_events.30.a:0 "Excellent"
IMPFED_events.31.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] refuses our offer of protection"
IMPFED_events.31.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] representative has declined our invitation to the Commonwealth, stressing that [FROM.GetNameDef] has no need of our protection, and no interest in surrendering its independence"
IMPFED_events.31.a:0 "Unfortunate"
IMPFED_events.31.b:0 "We find that answer... disappointing."
IMPFED_events.32.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] demands the return of our Indian Exclave"
IMPFED_events.32.d:0 "Responding, allegedly, to demands from the Indian Federal Government, the [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador has delivered to us a demand that our Indian Exclave be handed over to the Indian authorities. Currently, the enclave serves us primarily as a naval base, but also plays some role in international trade. That being said, a not insignificant number of our advisors have stated that it is not worth risking a war over, and recommend handing it over. On the other hand however, it would deal a blow to our national prestige, and limit our eastwards reach."
IMPFED_events.32.a:0 "It is only an enclave, very well."
IMPFED_events.32.b:0 "Never!"
IMPFED_events.33.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] hands over their enclave"
IMPFED_events.33.d:0 "In a brief handover ceremony, officials from [FROM.GetNameDef] have handed over their Indian Enclave to the Federal Government of India, bringing us one step closer to unity on the subcontinent."
IMPFED_events.33.a:0 "Excellent"
IMPFED_events.34.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] refuses to hand over their enclave"
IMPFED_events.34.d:0 "Emphasising the sovreignity of their overseas empire, [FROM.getnamedef] have refused to hand over their Indian Enclave to the Indian Federal Government, declaring that they would not surrender it freely to a foreign power."
IMPFED_events.34.a:0 "All this over a tiny enclave"
IMPFED_events.35.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] invites us to the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_events.35.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador has approached the government with a formal invitation to the Commonwealth, stressing our past friendship and good past relations. Should we join, we shall be protected from all external threats, recieve all the same rights as other Commonwealth territories, and gain access to Commonwealth investors. We would however, surrender part of our independence."
IMPFED_events.36.t:0 "Dealing With Siam"
IMPFED_events.36.d:0 "Siam poses a clear threat to our far eastern possessions, but the question remains: what should we do about them? The most obvious, but probably most costly option is outright war. A second option suggested is partitioning Siam between ourselves and France, incorperating it into Malaya and Indochina respectively. Alternatively, we could demand submission from them, effectively taking charge of their foreign relations without need for war or annexation. Finally, some have suggested that Siam simply isn't worth the effort, and is far less of a threat than we believe."
IMPFED_events.36.a:0 "Direct conquest is the only true solution"
IMPFED_events.36.b:0 "Splitting them with France is the best option"
IMPFED_events.36.c:0 "We shall demand their submission"
IMPFED_events.36.e:0 "Siam shall be left alone, but we will be on our guard."
IMPFED_events.37.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] and [FRA.GetNameDef] seek to partition us!"
IMPFED_events.37.d:0 "Unexpectedly, we have been approached by the [ENG.getadjective] and [FRA.getadjective] ambassadors declaring that [SIA.GetNameDef] is a threat to the stability of South-East Asia, and demanding for the immediate partition of our nation, threatening war if we refuse! Obviously, few wish to cave to their demands, but can we realistically hope to resist their combined forces?"
IMPFED_events.37.a:0 "We have no choice..."
IMPFED_events.37.b:0 "We shall not be carved up!"
IMPFED_events.38.t:0 "[SIA.getnamedef] folds"
IMPFED_events.38.d:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef] has folded to our demands for partition. Already our forces and officials have moved into Northern Malay, starting the process of annexing the territory into the Commonwealth"
IMPFED_events.38.a:0 "Northern Malay is ours!"
IMPFED_events.39.t:0 "[SIA.getnamedef] folds"
IMPFED_events.39.d:0 "As per our agreement with [ENG.GetNameDef], we have been handed over control of the rump of [SIA.getnamedef], which we can now incorperate into our Indochinese colonies."
IMPFED_events.39.a:0 "Siam is ours!"
IMPFED_events.40.t:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef] refuses!"
IMPFED_events.40.d:0 "The [SIA.GetAdjective] representative has sent us a strongly-worded response to our demands, declaring that they would never roll over and concede their sovreignity to European agression, vowing to fight to the end if necessary."
IMPFED_events.40.a:0 "It seems diplomacy has failed on this occasion..."
IMPFED_events.41.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] demands submission!"
IMPFED_events.41.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] ambasssador has approached us demanding the immediate submission of [SIA.GetNameDef] to the Commonwealth, declaring that we are a threat to the integrity and stability of South-East Asia! Obviously few are eager for us to cave to their demands, but can we realistically hope to resist in the event of war?"
IMPFED_events.41.a:0 "Better submission than annexation"
IMPFED_events.41.b:0 "We shall not surrender that easily!"
IMPFED_events.42.t:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef] submits to us"
IMPFED_events.42.d:0 "The [SIA.getadjective] representative has responded to our demands for submission, saying that, for the good of the [SIA.GetAdjective] people, they have agreed to our demands, granting our officials significant control over their country"
IMPFED_events.42.a:0 "Excellent"
IMPFED_events.43.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] requests control of West Papua"
IMPFED_events.43.d:0 "We have been approached by the [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador requesting that we transfer control of West Papua to them. This request has been sponsored by them on behalf of a Papuan nationalist group, who seek to unite with their fellow Papuans in Papua New Guinea under [ENG.GetNameDef], rather than be subjugated to the administration of Indonesia. What is our response?"
IMPFED_events.43.a:0 "If it is what the people want..."
IMPFED_events.43.b:0 "That territory belongs to Indonesia!"
IMPFED_events.44.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] tranfers West Papua"
IMPFED_events.44.d:0 "Following our request for West Papua, [FROM.getnamedef] has obliged, releasing the territory into our control. We shall now pass it on to the Papuan Federal Government."
IMPFED_events.44.a:0 "Good News!"
IMPFED_events.45.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] refuses to transfer West Papua"
IMPFED_events.45.d:0 "Officials from [FROM.GetNameDef] have responded to our request to reunify the Papuans, contesting the Papuan claim to the region, and claiming that it is rightfully part of Indonesia"
IMPFED_events.45.a:0 "Alas, we could not make them see sense."
IMPFED_events.46.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] offers us help in Federalising our Empire"
IMPFED_events.46.d:0 "We have been approached by [ENG.GetNameDef] with an interesting offer. They are offering to lend assistance to us should we seek to integate our overseas territories in a similar fashion to as they have done through their Imperial Federation. Do we accept this offer?"
IMPFED_events.46.a:0 "We gladly accept the offer!"
IMPFED_events.46.b:0 "This path is not for us to follow"
IMPFED_events.47.t:0 "[FROM.GetnameDef] requests assistance integating a territory"
IMPFED_events.47.d:0 "Our [FROM.GetAdjective] allies have requested that we lend assistance in integrating one of their territories into a federal state. What should we request as payment?"
IMPFED_events.47.a:0 "Monetary Payment shall be sufficient"
IMPFED_events.47.b:0 "We could do with some extra equipment for our armies"
IMPFED_events.47.c:0 "A contribution of naval parts would be useful"
IMPFED_events.47.e:0 "Sending an engineering company to aid our construction projects would be nice"
IMPFED_events.47.f:0 "Political Favour is all we ask"
IMPFED_events.48.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts our Offer"
IMPFED_events.48.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has replied favourably to our offer of providing assistance to them when integrating parts of their overseas Empire. They shall now intermittently get in contact with us when they are ready to begin integrating a territory"
IMPFED_events.48.a:0 "Glad to help!"
IMPFED_events.49.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef refuses our offer"
IMPFED_events.49.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] have turned down our offer of providing assistance to them when integrating parts of their overseas Empire, saying that they do not walk the same path as we have."
IMPFED_events.49.a:0 "We only wanted to help..."
IMPFED_events.50.t:0 "The Rebellion begins"
IMPFED_events.50.d:0 "With [ENG.GetAdjective] help, we have risen against a former oppressors, though we must act fast if we want to organise a proper defence of our new state"
IMPFED_events.50.a:0 "For the people pf [ROOT.Getname]"
IMPFED_events.52.t:0 "Alligning Persia"
IMPFED_events.52.d:0 "Persia has long been part of our sphere of influence: it guards a key enterance to India, and acts as a buffer state between ourselves and the Russians. On top of that, we have considerable assets in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, along with significant political influence in Eastern Persia, mirroring Russian influence in the west of the country. Before they fell to communism, we had even considered partitioning the country on occasion with the Russians, though the Shahs of Persia had always deftly played us off against each other. The time may have come however, for us to take a more forceful approach with the Shah of Iran. The question remains however, how should we approach the situation?" 
IMPFED_events.53.t:0 "Alligning Afganistan"
IMPFED_events.53.d:0 "Known as the graveyard of empires for a reason, we have first-hand experiance of the difficulties in invading the mountainous kingdom of Afghanistan. As such, in our past conflicts, we have often preferred allying a local faction, ensuring security by keeping a favourable king on the throne, often contesting the influence of the Russians in the region. Controlling the strategic passes across the Indus, ensuring that Afghanistan remains aligned to our cause will be key to preventing enemies invading western India"
IMPFED_events.54.t:0 "Alligning Yunnan"
IMPFED_events.54.d:0 "Situated in the mountains to the east of Burma, Yunnan sits in a strategic position commanding the path into China. Ensuring that they do not drift into allignment with our enemies will permit us to maintain the initiative on our far-eastern flank"
IMPFED_events.55.t:0 "Alligning the Guangxi Clique"
IMPFED_events.55.d:0 "Commanding the region that surrounds Hong Kong, the allignment Guangxi Clique is critical to the defence of the enclave, and is our natural passage to expand our influence into China."
IMPFED_events.56.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] demands our allignment"
IMPFED_events.56.d:0 "We have been approached by the [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador, who, through a large amount of diplomatic jargon and not-so-subtle dancing around the point, has effectively requested that we allign ourselves to their diplomatic goals, surrendering our control over foreign policy and becoming, in effect, a member of the Commonwealth. Whilst we could gain access to Commonwealth investors by complying, could that truely compare to our national independence?"
IMPFED_events.66.t:0 "The Governor-General Returns"
IMPFED_events.66.d:0 "The Official representative of the king of the Commonwealth and head of the Empire, the Governor-General has returned to our country to lead us in the king's name, his position now properly restored to the dignity he deserves following the brief deposition during the abdication crisis"
IMPFED_events.66.a:0 "Glory to his Majesty! God save the King!"

IMPFED_events.106.t:0 "Martial Law Breaks Down"
IMPFED_events.106.d:0 "Imperial Forces from Britain that previously attempted to impose martial law upon us to prevent us breaking with the crown over the abdication crisis can no longer effectively claim to hold complete control over us, with growing opposition to this unlawful oppression growing both within Britain and here.\n\n Now, with Imperial troops being withdrawn, and official government activity returning to normal, we have an opportunity to exact a reprisal against the British for opressing us, declaring our independece!"
IMPFED_events.106.a:0 "The time has come, we shall be free at last"
IMPFED_events.106.b:0 "On Second thoughts, we'd prefer to remain loyal to the crown"
IMPFED_events.107.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Breaks with the Crown"
IMPFED_events.107.d:0 "We have been informed by the [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives that [FROM.GetNameDef] can no longer tolerate the actions of the king, which, combined with our recent failed attempts to enforce loyalty, have proven to them that the people of [FROM.GetnameDef] can no longer look to [ROOT.GetNameDef] as its ally and mother country, and as such, they unilaterally declare their independence"
IMPFED_events.107.a:0 "We are powerless to stop them... for now."
IMPFED_events.107.b:0 "We are powerless to stop them... for now."
